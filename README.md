# LiveDebugger

LiveDebugger is a browser-based tool for debugging applications written in [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) - an Elixir library designed for building rich, interactive online experiences with server-rendered HTML.

Designed to enhance your development experience LiveDebugger gives you:

- :deciduous_tree: A detailed view of your LiveComponents tree
- :mag: The ability to inspect assigns for LiveViews and LiveComponents
- :link: Tracing of their callback executions

## Installation

Add `live_debugger` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:live_debugger, "~> 0.1.5", only: :dev}
    ]
  end
```

For full experience we recommend adding below line to your application root layout. It attaches `meta` tag and LiveDebugger scripts in dev environment enabling browser features.

```elixir
  # lib/my_app_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex

  <head>
    <%= Application.get_env(:live_debugger, :live_debugger_tags) %>
  </head>
```

After you start your application LiveDebugger will be running at a default port `http://localhost:4007`.

> [!WARNING]  
> LiveDebugger should not be used on production! Make sure that the dependency you've added is `:dev` only

## Browser features

List of browser features:

- Debug button
- Components highlighting (coming soon!)

Some features require injecting JS into the debugged application. You can disable them in your config.

```elixir
# config/dev.exs

# Disables all browser features and does not inject LiveDebugger JS
config :live_debugger, browser_features?: false

# Disables only debug button
config :live_debugger, debug_button?: false
```

### Content Security Policy

In `router.ex` of your Phoenix app, make sure your locally running Phoenix app can access the LiveDebugger JS files on port 4007. To achieve that you may need to extend your CSP in `:dev` mode:

```elixir
  @csp "{...your CSP} #{if Mix.env() == :dev, do: "http://127.0.0.1:4007"}"

  pipeline :browser do
    # ...
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers, %{"content-security-policy" => @csp}
```

## Igniter

LiveDebugger has [Igniter](https://github.com/ash-project/igniter) support - an alternative for standard mix installation. It'll automatically add LiveDebugger dependency and modify your `root.html.heex` after you use the below command.

```bash
mix igniter.install live_debugger
```

Make sure that added dependency is `:dev` only.

## Optional configuration

```elixir
# config/dev.exs

config :live_debugger,
  ip: {127, 0, 0, 1}, # IP on which LiveDebugger will be hosted
  port: 4007, # Port on which LiveDebugger will be hosted
  secret_key_base: <SECRET_KEY_BASE>, # Secret key used for LiveDebugger.Endpoint
  signing_salt: "your_signing_salt", # Signing salt used for LiveDebugger.Endpoint
  adapter: Bandit.PhoenixAdapter # Adapter used in LiveDebugger.Endpoint
  tracing_setup_delay: 0 # Time in ms after tracing will be initialized. Useful in case multi-nodes envs
```

## Contributing

For those planning to contribute to this project, you can run a dev version of the debugger with the following commands:

```console
mix setup
iex -S mix
```

It'll run the application declared in the `dev/` directory with the library installed.

LiveReload is working both for `.ex` files and static files, but if some styles don't show up, try using this command

```console
mix assets.build:dev
```
