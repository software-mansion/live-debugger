LiveDebugger is a browser-based tool for debugging applications written in [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) - an Elixir library designed for building rich, interactive online experiences with server-rendered HTML.

Designed to enhance your development experience LiveDebugger gives you:

- :deciduous_tree: A detailed view of your LiveComponents tree
- :mag: The ability to inspect assigns for LiveViews and LiveComponents
- :link: Tracing and filtering of their callback executions
- :flashlight: Components highlighting

## Getting started

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> LiveDebugger should not be used on production - make sure that the dependency you've added is `:dev` only

### Mix installation

Add `live_debugger` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:live_debugger, "~> 0.3.0", only: :dev}
    ]
  end
```

For full experience we recommend adding below line to your application root layout. It attaches `meta` tag and LiveDebugger scripts in dev environment enabling browser features.

```elixir
  # lib/my_app_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex

  <head>
    <%= Application.get_env(:live_debugger, :live_debugger_tags) %>
  </head>
```

After you start your application, LiveDebugger will be running at a default port `http://localhost:4007`.

### Igniter installation

LiveDebugger has [Igniter](https://github.com/ash-project/igniter) support - an alternative for standard mix installation. It'll automatically add LiveDebugger dependency and modify your `root.html.heex` after you use the below command.

```bash
mix igniter.install live_debugger
```

### DevTools extension

Since version v0.2.0 you can install official LiveDebugger DevTools extension, giving you the ability to interact with its features alongside your application's runtime.

- [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gmdfnfcigbfkmghbjeelmbkbiglbmbpe)
- [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livedebugger-devtools/)

> [!NOTE]  
> Ensure the main LiveDebugger dependency is added to your mix project, as the browser plugin alone is not enough.

## Optional configuration

### Browser features

Some features require injecting JS into the debugged application. They are enabled by default, but you can disable them in your config.

```elixir
# config/dev.exs

# Disables all browser features and does not inject LiveDebugger JS
config :live_debugger, :browser_features?, false

# Disables only debug button
config :live_debugger, :debug_button?, false

# Disables only components highlighting
config :live_debugger, :highlighting?, false

# Used when LiveDebugger's assets are exposed on other address (e.g. when run inside Docker)
config :live_debugger, :external_url, "http://localhost:9007"
```

### Content Security Policy

In `router.ex` of your Phoenix app, make sure your locally running Phoenix app can access the LiveDebugger JS files on port 4007. To achieve that you may need to extend your CSP in `:dev` mode:

```elixir
  @csp "{...your CSP} #{if Mix.env() == :dev, do: "http://127.0.0.1:4007"}"

  pipeline :browser do
    # ...
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers, %{"content-security-policy" => @csp}
```

### Other

```elixir
# config/dev.exs

# Allows you to disable LiveDebugger manually if needed
config :live_debugger, :disabled?, true

# Time in ms after tracing will be initialized. Useful in case multi-nodes envs
config :live_debugger, :tracing_setup_delay, 0

# Used when working with code reloading and traces are not visible.
# WARNING! This may cause some performance issues.
config :live_debugger, :tracing_update_on_code_reload?, true

# LiveDebugger endpoint config
config :live_debugger,
  ip: {127, 0, 0, 1}, # IP on which LiveDebugger will be hosted
  port: 4007, # Port on which LiveDebugger will be hosted
  secret_key_base: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_BASE", # Secret key used for LiveDebugger.Endpoint
  signing_salt: "your_signing_salt", # Signing salt used for LiveDebugger.Endpoint
  adapter: Bandit.PhoenixAdapter, # Adapter used in LiveDebugger.Endpoint
  server: true, # Forces LiveDebugger to start even if project is not started with the `mix phx.server`

# Name for LiveDebugger PubSub (it will create new one so don't put already used name)
config :live_debugger, :pubsub_name, LiveDebugger.CustomPubSub
```

## Contributing

For those planning to contribute to this project, you can run a dev version of the debugger with the following commands:

```console
mix setup
iex -S mix
```

It'll run the application declared in the `dev/` directory with the library installed.

LiveReload is working both for `.ex` files and static files, but if some styles don't show up, try using this command

```console
mix assets.build:dev
```
