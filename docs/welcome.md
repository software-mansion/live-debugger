LiveDebugger is a browser-based tool for debugging applications written in [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) - an Elixir library designed for building rich, interactive online experiences with server-rendered HTML.

Designed to enhance your development experience LiveDebugger gives you:

- A detailed view of your LiveComponents tree ([`Components Tree`](./components_tree.md))
- The ability to inspect assigns for LiveViews and LiveComponents ([`Assigns Inspection`](./assigns_inspection.md))
- Tracing of their callback executions ([`Callback Tracing`](./callback_tracing.md))
- Highlighting components in debugged app ([`Components Highlighting`](./components_highlighting.md))

## Installation

> #### Important {: .info}
>
> LiveDebugger should not be used on production - make sure that the dependency you've added is `:dev` only

<!-- tabs-open -->

### Mix installation

Add `live_debugger` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:live_debugger, "~> 0.3.0", only: :dev}
    ]
  end
```

For full experience we recommend adding below line to your application root layout. It attaches `meta` tag and LiveDebugger scripts in dev environment enabling browser features.

```elixir
  # lib/my_app_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex

  <head>
    <%= Application.get_env(:live_debugger, :live_debugger_tags) %>
  </head>
```

After you start your application, LiveDebugger will be running at a default port `http://localhost:4007`.

### Igniter installation

LiveDebugger has [Igniter](https://github.com/ash-project/igniter) support - an alternative for standard mix installation. It'll automatically add LiveDebugger dependency and modify your `root.html.heex` after you use the below command.

```bash
mix igniter.install live_debugger
```

<!-- tabs-close -->

### DevTools extension

Since version v0.2.0 you can install official LiveDebugger DevTools extension, giving you the ability to interact with its features alongside your application's runtime.

- [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gmdfnfcigbfkmghbjeelmbkbiglbmbpe)
- [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livedebugger-devtools/)

> #### Note {: .info}
>
> Ensure the main LiveDebugger dependency is added to your mix project, as the browser plugin alone is not enough.
