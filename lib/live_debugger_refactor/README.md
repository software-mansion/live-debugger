### LiveDebuggerRefactor

In this module we put refactored modules that are currently dead and not used by LiveDebugger app. You shouldn't care about modules in this directory, unless you want to contribute to refactor.

To start refactored LiveDebugger add to your config:

```elixir
config :live_debugger, :refactor, true
```
