defmodule LiveDebuggerRefactor.Bus do
  @moduledoc """
  This module is responsible for broadcasting events inside LiveDebugger.

  Bus is built on top of Phoenix.PubSub. It uses 3 types of topics:
  - `lvdbg/*` - general topic used to broadcast general events to all processes.
  - `lvdbg/traces/*` - traces topic used to broadcast traces to all processes.
  - `lvdbg/states/*` - states topic used to broadcast states to all processes.

  The `*` in the topic is a wildcard. It can be replaced with pid of debugged process or debugger LiveView depending on the event type.

  It needs to be added to the supervision tree of the application using `append_bus_tree/1` function.
